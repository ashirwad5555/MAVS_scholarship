          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
            With this objective in mind,{" "}
            <b>Maharashtra Arya Vaishya Samaj, Pune</b>started an initiative
            Titled <b>“MAVS Vidya Adhar”</b> on the auspicious occasion of
            Akshat-Tritiya in May 2022.
            <br />
            The Program aims to provide financial support to meritorious
            students pursuing Higher Education (Graduation / PG) and are
            stretched financial to pay education fees. This financial assistance
            is to be refunded by students after two years of completing their
            higher education.
            <br />
            The Prog. Runs on the donations provided by our community members.
            We are collecting 200/- / 300 Rs. Per month from members.
            <br />
            We created a Whatsapp groups of all such Contributors and donation
            is to be strictly paid online by Gpay / PhonePay and to be posted on
            that WA group. One can pay 200 Rs. Or 300/- are. every month but we
            prefer annual payment of 2400/- or 3600/- for better tracking
            management of accounts. Payment is to be done on Phone number given
            in the group DP. In last 11 months since May 2022, we collected 3.7
            Lakh Rs and in Nov. 2022 we supported 5 students by giving them
            financial assistance of total 2.25 Lakhs. The last years aid of Rs.
            2.25 Lakhs is to be paid for next three years, till they complete
            their education. We also have plan to give support atleast 5 new
            students pan India with support of 2.5 to 3 Lakhs in 2023.
            <br />
            To continue the commitment of last years 2.25 Lakhs and new support
            of 3 Lakhs, we need to increase the number of contributors. In last
            one month the members increased from 200 to 375 Our next target is
            to reach 400.
            <br />
            With this , we are appealing all our community members to create
            awareness about Vidya-Adhar Prog and enroll more contributors and
            also reach out to more students to take benefit of this Prog.
            <br />
